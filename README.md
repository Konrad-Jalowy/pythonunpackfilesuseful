# pythonunpackfilesuseful
**You know what i hate - people who create tutorials or even udemy courses for beginners sending archives packed in linux without the extension making poor windows-using newbies confused. The best approach is to just change the name and add zip extension to it then unpack. However windows likes to complicate simple things and in general, i want to solve the problem with one click**

**So some time ago i actually created something useful in Python. It takes an archive without proper extension and unpacks it and shows unpacked contents. I compiled it and did some batch black magic i dont remember but it made my compiled app an extension app so when i right click a file my compiled program is click away. Moreover, the name of the clicked file lands in argv.**

**I did it long time ago, thought its a great idea and learning experience. 1000 archives without zip extension later i actually noticed i created something useful. It was such a shock to me, after all those to-do lists and chat web applications that i took my sweet time to find this project. Especially since people say i need "experience" but there is no way i can get it, why not show off the apps i create?**

**And remember - never post archives without an extension if you do tutorials or courses for newbies. You will only discourage them.**
